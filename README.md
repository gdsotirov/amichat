# AMI Chat

## Summary

This chat was created for the Academy of the Ministry of Interior (AMI) and
is very simple. It was specially purposed for the Online education program of
the academy.

## Features

Users log in directly into the public chat room and could exchange messages
in different chat rooms. There is panel on the left showing online users count
and aliases. Users could change password, alias, name and color as well as
the timeout for refresh in seconds and the number of displayed messages.
Administrators log in separately and could manage the following:
